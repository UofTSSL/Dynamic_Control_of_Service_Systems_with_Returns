Includes:
- cost-focused 'original' simulations (exploring varying holding cost and intervention cost)
- rate-focused 'alt' simulations (exploring varying initial arrival rate and return arrival rate)

- The {lin/quad}_{steady/trans}_{alt/nothing}.py each correspond to the experiments linear/quadratic intervention cost, long-run/transient horizon, alt (rate-varying) / original (cost-varying) sims.
- Outputs are organized in the respective folders {quad/lin}_{cost/rate}
- The figures are generated by the notebooks
